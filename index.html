            <h1>My Favorite Sport</h1>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <hr>
             <p>My favorite sport is soccer. Essentialy, it's just a game where there are boundaries around two big nets, two teams, and a ball. Both teams have to try and get the ball in the other team's net.</p>
             <hr>
             <h2>Rules</h2>
             <p><span style="background-color:red">Rule Number 1: "You can't inflict injuries on opposing players." This will result in a yellow card, which is the warning in a game, and the red card means you get kicked out of the game.</span>
                 <br><span style="background-color:yellow">Rule Number 2: You can't try and score the ball from inside the goalie box.</span><br><span style="background-color:orange">Rule Number 3:If you go out of boundaries, then the ball is given to te other team in two ways; by a throw in, or a goalie kick, depending on where the ball went out.</span><br> -These are the most essential rules to start playing soccer.</p>
                 <hr>
                 <h2>History</h2>
                 <p>Soccer was originated around the 16<sup>th</sup> century. The British actually <i><strong>banned soccer because the military stopped working</strong></i> and they started playing soccer. Soccer is very unique and was and still is played in many different ways around the world.</p>
                 <h2>Famous Players</h2>
                 <hr>
                 <p>Some of the most famous players include Pele, who is said to be the greatest of all time, Ronaldo, and many more.
<b>Pele</b> is known for his <i><mark>bicycle kick, while is considered the hardest move to ever execute in the whole game.</mark></i> How it works is, you stand in front of the ball, and you front-flip over the ball, and the force is said to kick the ball far and high.
<b>Ronaldo</b> is known for his passing in the game. He passes the ball so fast, that nobody can even see it.
<br><br><br>
<p>Overall, soccer is a very entertaining sport, which is very fun for you to bond and fun with all of your friends.</p>
